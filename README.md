# PiholeBlockList
Add ``` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SF-Rocker/PiholeBlockList/refs/heads/main/SiteBlock.txt``` to Pihole List
Uses Sources so multiple domains do not get scattered and confused in updating Gravity in Tools.

Use ```pihole -r ``` if sources crash.
use ```pihole -g``` to populate gravity list from ssh terminal.
